//Defining a function(Main function)
//Function= Magic button, things happen when you click it.
//Main function is the first thing that the compiler search for in a code when it has to excecute the code.
//For every java code you have to write these 2 things (defining the class and the main function)
//Thus, this template part of code is called [BOILERPLATE CODE]

        System.out.println("Hello World!\n Hello");
        System.out.print("Hello World!\n");

//FOR OUTPUT
//print=function
// [;]->Statement Terminator

//ln= used for printing in next line (or else hello world will print back to back in one line)(eg. line 13)
//Or use \n (eg. line 14,15)
